# My Project

This Rust project is named "my_project." It includes the following files and code functions:

## 1. rust.yml

The `rust.yml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file. It sets up a GitHub Actions workflow named "Clippy" that is triggered on pushes to the main branch and pull requests. The workflow runs on an Ubuntu latest runner and performs the following steps:
- Checks out the code repository.
- Configures the Rust toolchain with Clippy and Rustfmt components.
- Formats the code using `make format`.
- Lints the code using `make lint`.
- Runs tests using `make test`.

This workflow ensures that code formatting and linting are enforced, and tests are run automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch or in pull requests.

## 2. src Folder and Files

The `src` folder contains the source code for the Rust project. It typically includes the following files:
- `lib.rs`: This file often contains library code and data structures.
- `main.rs`: This file typically includes the entry point for the application, setting up the project, and running the program.

You can add your project-specific code to these files to build your Rust application.

## 3. Cargo.toml

The `Cargo.toml` file is the project configuration file for Rust. It defines project metadata and dependencies. Here's a sample `Cargo.toml` for "my_project":
```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rusqlite = "0.25"
thiserror = "1.0"

[lib]
name = "my_project"
path = "src/lib.rs"

[[bin]]
name = "my_project"
path = "src/main.rs"
```

This `Cargo.toml` specifies project metadata, dependencies, and binary/library configurations.

## 4. Makefile

The `Makefile` is used for simplifying and automating common development tasks. In your project, the Makefile includes the following targets:
- `format`: Formats the code using `cargo fmt --quiet`.
- `lint`: Lints the code using `cargo clippy --quiet`.
- `test`: Runs tests using `cargo test --quiet`.
- `run`: Runs the project using `cargo run`.
- `run-release`: Runs the project in release mode using `cargo run --release --bin my_binary`.
- `all`: A convenience target that runs `format`, `lint`, `test`, and `run` in that order.

These Makefile targets allow you to easily format, lint, test, and run your Rust project by running `make` commands in your terminal.
