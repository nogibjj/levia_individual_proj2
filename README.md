# Rust Project

This is a Rust project named "my_project" that contains the following files and code functions:

## `rust.yml`

The `rust.yml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file named "Clippy." It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and pull requests and runs on an Ubuntu latest runner. The workflow consists of the following steps:

- Check out the code repository.
- Configure the Rust toolchain with Clippy and Rustfmt components.
- Format the code using `make format`.
- Lint the code using `make lint`.
- Run tests using `make test`.

This workflow ensures that code formatting and linting are enforced, and tests are automatically executed when changes are pushed to the main branch or in pull requests.

## `src` Folder and Files

The `src` folder contains the source code for the Rust project. Typically, it includes two main files:

- `lib.rs`: This file often contains library code and data structures.
- `main.rs`: This file typically includes the entry point for the application, sets up the project, and runs the program.

You can add your project-specific code to these files to build your Rust application.

## `Cargo.toml`

The `Cargo.toml` file is the project configuration file for Rust. It defines project metadata and dependencies. Here's a sample `Cargo.toml` for "my_project":

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
rusqlite = "0.25"
thiserror = "1.0"

[lib]
name = "my_project"
path = "src/lib.rs"

[[bin]]
name = "my_project"
path = "src/main.rs"
```

This `Cargo.toml` specifies project metadata, dependencies, and binary/library configurations.

## `Makefile`

The `Makefile` is used to simplify and automate common development tasks. In your project, the Makefile includes the following targets:

- `format`: Formats the code using `cargo fmt --quiet`.
- `lint`: Lints the code using `cargo clippy --quiet`.
- `test`: Runs tests using `cargo test --quiet`.
- `run`: Runs the project using `cargo run`.
- `run-release`: Runs the project in release mode using `cargo run --release --bin my_binary`.
- `all`: A convenience target that runs `format`, `lint`, `test`, and `run` in that order.

These Makefile targets make it easy to format, lint, test, and run your Rust project by simply running `make` commands in your terminal.
